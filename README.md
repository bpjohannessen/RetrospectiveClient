# Retrospective Client.
A client to use during a team retrospective to create notes and publish them to a Slack channel.

## Requirements.
- Windows.
- Slack Webhook (required from you're Slack administrator).

## What is it.
The idea behind creating a application like this was that I got tired of keeping notes of my retrospectives. I used to start up my favorite editor, create three headers for positives notes, negatives notes and actions and start taking notes when we were having the meeting. When the meeting was over, I used to save this locally and share it with my colleagues.

We finally started using Slack. My workflow was still somewhat the same, but now I did not have to save it locally, and we now hade one place to share the notes afterwards. 

After a while, I figured out that I wanted to try to make a application to write down my notes and that would publish a message before we started and a summary of my notes when we finished the meeting. This is the result.
